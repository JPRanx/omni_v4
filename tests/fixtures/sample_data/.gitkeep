# Test fixtures directory

This directory contains sample Toast POS data files for testing.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Employee Data Privacy

Files in this directory contain employee names and personal information and should NEVER be committed to git.

The .gitignore is configured to exclude:
- PayrollExport*.csv (employee names, hours, pay)
- TimeEntries*.csv (employee names, clock in/out times)
- All CSV and Excel files in this directory

## For Developers

When adding test data:
1. Place files in date-specific subdirectories (e.g., 2025-10-20/SDR/)
2. Ensure .gitignore rules are working: `git check-ignore -v <file>`
3. Never commit files with real employee data
4. Use anonymized/fake data for committed test fixtures if needed

## Current Structure

```

├── YYYY-MM-DD/
│   ├── SDR/

│   │   ├── TimeEntries_YYYY_MM_DD.csv (ignored)
│   │   └── ... other Toast reports
│   ├── T12/

```

Files exist locally but are not tracked in version control.
